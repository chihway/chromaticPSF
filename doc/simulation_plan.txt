* all the sims below are generated for 6 filters, 10 chips, 
  1000 realizations of the atmosphere and the instrument (?)
  one star image and one galaxy image

* from all sims we measure delta_x, delta_e, delta_R, g, and 
  towards the end, correlation of these, perhaps

* stars=point source
  galaxy=some sypical representative gaussian (?) 

============================================================

0) null test: galaxies randomly selected from CatSim, bright star and galaxy 
have same SED and are located at same position (on a grid)
- turn off all effects (telescopemode=0 natmospherefile=0 atmdispersion=0)
- turn on atm but not DCR (telescopemode=0 atmdispersion=0)
- turn on DCR (telescopemode=0)
- turn on optics but not detector (detectormode=0)
- turn on detector
=> this should all yield zero, at least roughly

1) chromatic PSF test: bright galaxies and stars randomly selected from CatSim, 
star and galaxy have different SED but are located at same position (on a grid)
- turn off all effects (telescopemode=0 natmospherefile=0 atmdispersion=0)
- turn on atm but not DCR (telescopemode=0 atmdispersion=0)
- turn on DCR (telescopemode=0)
- turn on optics but not detector (detectormode=0)
- turn on detector
=> the difference between 1) and 0) tells us how much chromatic effects are 
contributed from the different physical effects
=> can analyze from the results here how different SED types interact

2) PSF interpolation test: same as 1), but now stars are randomly located 
in a realistic way, and interpolation is needed. 
- only do the turn on everything tests from now on
=> different between 2) and 1) tells us how interpolation can (maybe?) average 
some of the chromatic effects

3) realistic population test: now put in the full population of stars and 
galaxies (photon noise included), may need to do this on full focal plane?
- evaluate the systematics caused by these chromatic effects in a full, 
(sort of) realistic LSST survey
